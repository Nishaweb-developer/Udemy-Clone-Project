# Udemy Clone Project

This project is a simple **Udemy Clone** built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The main objective of this project is to recreate the basic structure and layout of the popular Udemy website to practice front-end skills, particularly focusing on the **flexbox** and **nested flex** layout models.

## Project Features

- **Responsive Design**: The project layout is responsive across different screen sizes.
- **Flexbox Layout**: The site is built using the **flexbox** model, ensuring clean, flexible, and scalable alignment of elements.
- **Nested Flex Containers**: To create complex layouts, nested flex containers have been used to refine the design further.
- **HTML Structure**: The project follows semantic HTML5 standards.
- **CSS Styling**: The styles are written in pure CSS without any frameworks, ensuring a clear understanding of fundamental CSS techniques.

## Key Sections

The Udemy Clone includes the following sections:

1. **Navigation Bar**: A fully responsive navigation bar that collapses appropriately for mobile screens.
2. **Course Listing**: A grid-like display of various courses, designed using **nested flexboxes** to maintain a clean and structured look.
3. **Featured Categories**: A flexible container to highlight key course categories.
4. **Footer**: A well-structured footer with essential links and social media icons, again using flexbox for alignment.
